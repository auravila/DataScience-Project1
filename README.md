# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**


This dataset contains results of marketing contact campaings from a set of bank customers also includes customer demographics, consumer & confidence indexes 
and other statistics. We seek to predict the likelihood of contracting a loan after being targeted via a marketing campaing.  


**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**

The approach taken to create the experiments was based on a classification model, the results of accuracy of 0.90 provides great confidence in the experiment run
nevertheless this is the result of a discrete set of values for random sampling and with a limited set of iteractions. 


## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

choosing a discrete set of parameters guarantees the same probability to each value of the list. A small set of parameters provides a quick turnaround of the
experiment results for initial evaluation.

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

The policy early terminates a child run where the primary metric is not met withing the policies defined parameters.

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
